## JavaScript

Before starting this tutorial, let us understand first: **What is JavaScript?** <br>
Well, JavaScript (JS) is a client-side scripting language that is used to make websites interactive. Here, you need to know two things: **client-side** and **interactive**.

The **client-side** means JavaScript runs on the client browser. Every modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc. have a built-in JavaScript engine that runs or executes JavaScript code. For example, Chrome has a JavaScript engine called [V8](https://v8.dev/) that is responsible for executing JavaScript code inside the browser.

The other word, **interactive**, means JavaScript is used to make a website alive. For example, when you press a button in a shopping website, you expect that button to do something like adding items to a cart, search for a product, remove items from cart, display next product, etc. All the interactions are initiated by the user and the browser responds to those user events by performing appropriate actions. JavaScript is the medium/mediator/bridge that makes this possible.

This is the simple explanation that I can give about JavaScript. If you want to be technical, fancy, standard or savvy, you can define JavaScript as how wikipedia defines it as:<br>
> JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

Wow, that's a lot to take in, I know. If you are in confusion, trust me, I also didn't get it either reading it the first time. :grin:

Now that you have understood what JavaScript is about, in the next chapter, we will dive right into JavaScript fundamentals.
